**Biography**

Hi, I’m Jieteng Chen. Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Marketing at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School, advised by Professor T. Tony Ke. My research lies at the intersection of marketing and economics, with a particular focus on economics of AI, generative AI, online platforms, and industrial organization. 


Before CUHK, I received a B.A. in Economics from Xiamen University. During my doctoral studies, I also spent one year as a visiting student at Yale University (2024–2025). I will be on the 2025–2026 academic job market.
