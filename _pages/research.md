* ["Designing Detection Algorithms for AI-Generated Content: Consumer Inference, Creator Incentives, and Platform Strategy"](https://jietengchen.github.io/files/detection_JMP.pdf), Jieteng Chen, T. Tony Ke, and Jiwoong Shin, *under review*, *Marketing Science*
  + This paper shows that platforms' AI-generated content detection algorithms affect both consumer inference and creator incentives.

* "[Regulating Digital Piracy Consumption](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222437241256372)'', Jieteng Chen, Yuetao Gao, and T. Tony Ke. *Journal of Marketing Research*, 61.6 (2024): 1096-1115.
  + This paper shows that regulators' penalty on piracy users may inadvertently promote piracy consumption.
  + Generative AI has transformed content creation, enhancing efficiency and scalability across media platforms. However, it also introduces substantial risks, particularly the spread of misinformation that can undermine consumer trust and platform credibility. In response, platforms deploy detection algorithms to distinguish AI-generated from human-created content, but these systems face inherent trade-offs: aggressive detection lowers false negatives (failing to detect AI-generated content) but raises false positives (misclassifying human content), discouraging good creators. Conversely, conservative detection protects creators but weakens the informational value of labels, eroding consumer trust. We develop a model in which a platform sets the detection threshold, consumers form beliefs from content labels and decide whether to engage, and creators choose whether to adopt AI and how much effort to exert to create content. A central insight is that detection does not affect outcomes continuously: instead, equilibrium structure shifts discontinuously as the threshold changes. At low thresholds, consumers trust human labels and partially engage with AI-labeled content, disciplining AI misuse and boosting engagement. But when detection threshold becomes higher, this inference breaks down, AI adoption rises, and both trust and engagement collapse. Thus, the platformâ€™s optimal detection strategy balances these risks, influencing content creation incentives, consumer beliefs, and overall welfare. 

Working Papers
======
* ["From Canvas to Blockchain: Impact of Royalties on Art Market Efficiency"](https://jietengchen.github.io/files/art.pdf), Xinyu Cao, Jieteng Chen, Tony Ke, *minor revision*, *Management Science*,   (Equal contribution in alphabetical order.)
  + This paper shows that royalties for artists act as taxation and thus introduce inefficiency to resale markets but may improve primary market efficiency by reducing price distortions.

* Algorithmic Allocation: Match Quality and Labor Supply on a Two-Sided Market, Jieteng Chen and Chongyan Sun
  + This paper shows that the preferential allocation algorithm may backfire by disincentivizing drivers' labor supply. 

* ["Data Externalities and Data Acquisition by Online Platforms"](https://jietengchen.github.io/files/data_externalities.pdf), Jieteng Chen and T. Tony Ke
  + This paper shows that the online platform may acquire data from more or fewer consumers as the information correlation rises.
